# timetk for Python <img src="logo-timetk.png" align="right" height="138" />

> The time series toolkit for Python

This library is currently under development and is not intended for general usage yet. Functionality is experimental until release 0.1.0.

## Usage

This is a simple code to test the function [`summarize_by_time()`](/reference/summarize_by_time.html):

### Import Libraries & Data

```{python}
import timetk
import pandas as pd
from timetk import load_dataset

df = load_dataset('bike_sales_sample')
df['order_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['order_date'])

df   
```

### Summarize By Time (For a Monthly Aggregation)

We can obtain a grouped monthly aggregation in two lines of code:
```{python}
summary_df = df \
    .groupby("category_1") \
    .summarize_by_time(
        date_column  ='order_date', 
        value_column = 'total_price',
        rule         = "MS",
        agg_func     = 'sum',
        wide_format  = True
    )

summary_df
```

And it's easy to visualize with `plotly`. 
```{python}
#| warning: false
import plotly.express as px

px.line(
    summary_df, 
    x = 'order_date', 
    y = ['total_price_Mountain', 'total_price_Road'],
    template = "plotly_dark",    
    title = "Monthly Sales of Mountain and Road Bicycles"
)
```
